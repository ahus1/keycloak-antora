= Keycloak docs with Antora Proof-of-Concept

== Content of the repository

antora::
Folder with templates for the site and Antora's configurations
+
This should eventually be moved to its own Git repository as it is independent of the modules and their releases.

doc-original::
The server-guide and operator-guide in the new format, and the admin-guide in the old format.
Taken as a snapshot from the current development branch.
For the guides, the freemarker templating has been completed.

doc::
Documentation re-organized documentation from above put into the Antora folder structure. The update of internal references is complete for the new guides, and incomplete for the old admin guide.
+
To see what has changed, compare the files in the two folders.

== Concepts and Questions

Concepts:

* Antora components contain the version, and it can have multiple modules that share the same version.
* A navigation is based on the component and spans multiple modules
* A link from one component to another component that doesn't specify a component version will link to the latest release of that component.
+
To link to the same version of a component, use for example `++xref:{page-version}@guides-server::importExport.adoc[]++`

Questions:

* Should all artifacts that share the same version number (Keycloak server and Keycloak operator) be in the same component?

Concept:

* When stripping the `.html` at the end of an URL, there can be either a page or a folder with that name.

Question:

* How show the parent page be named compared to the folder?
As an itermediate solution, all parent pages received the `-all` suffix.

Concept:

* All files inside pages are rendered as HTML and should be references in nav.aodc

Question:

* Decide which includes should be converted to pages, and which should be moved to partials.

== Todos for a real site

* Consider Algolia for a hosted search service instead of client-side JavaScript search, as the index would overwise grow too big.
